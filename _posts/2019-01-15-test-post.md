Finally I have my own tiny corner of the internet. I have been meaning to get started with blogging for a while and after toying around with the idea for about a month, I managed to muster enough commitment for this enterprise. 

I remember opening up a wordpress blog ages ago but I never really got around to using it. So I took to the internet to evaluaute my options for setting up a blog and contracted a serious case of decision fatigue. There are so many blogging platforms and website builders out there now, offering you so many different lucrative packages, Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, Medium etc. 

And so I reached out to this guy called Daniel Bourke, asking him for advice on which platform to get started with for blogging. He's quite popular on the internet and I love his content, you should definitely check him out if you're into AI and education. His blog was super simple and minimal and pretty much what I wanted for myself. And it was built on Squarespace. But then he told me, he had that set up way before he knew how to code and if he could do it again, he'd definitely look into using GitHub Pages. 

And that's how I found out about Jekyll and this awesome blog was born. Thanks Daniel.

So what exactly is this blog going to be about? Just my thoughts and opinions and lots of tech stuff.

I'm excited.
