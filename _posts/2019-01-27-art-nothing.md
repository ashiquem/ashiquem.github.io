About a month ago, I had a minor accident. I managed to fall on my face and bust my chin open. For the first time in my life, I had to get stitches. To my surprise, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. And it was on my face, a part of your body that enjoys a good amount of blood supply, which means it should heal relatively fast. At least in *theory*. 

On my second visit to the doctor to get my wound dressed, he wasn't entirely happy with the healing progress. I was shocked. Feeling betrayed by my own body, I asked the doctor:

> "I'm a fairly healthy young man. If my wound isn't healing as fast as it should, what do you think I'm doing wrong?"

He then asked me: 

> "Umm, do you smoke?"

I have been a smoker for the majority of my adulthood. I enjoyed smoking a lot, but for the last couple of years, I've had a love-hate relationship with smoking. The harmful effects of smoking is definitely no secret and I have felt so many times how it hurts my physical fitness, leaving me gasping for air whenever I went for a run. I have tried so many things to quit. I started vaping, lugging around those huge boxes and blowing out huge clouds, didn't really cut it after a while and I went back to smoking. Then I tried those juul kind of vaping devices. No matter what, I kept on going back to the good old cigarette to get my fix. 

> "Yes I do, but I'm not really a heavy smoker. Smoking slows down the healing of wounds? Really?"

Well, it turns out smoking inhibits the delivery of the most important thing for your wound healing process, **oxygen**. The thousands of chemicals inside cigarettes degrades your respiratory and cardiovascular performance and results in less oxygen being delivered to your tissues. Also, the carbon monoxide present in smoke affects your red blood cells' abilities to deliver oxygen. This is actually a very well known and [studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1323208)  problem in the clinical world.

Initially I felt betrayed by my body for not healing as fast as it should. Now I felt that I have betrayed my body. Something needed to be done. And so I **quit.** 

Being a smoker for almost a **decade**, this certainly wasn't an easy task. But to my own surprise, it was so much **easier** than my earlier failed attempts. I consistently made a decision to not smoke every single day. It has been over 6 weeks now since I last smoked and I feel great. Being the curious kind, I wanted to dissect my success to see how what I could learn from it. So how did I do something so easily - something I struggled to accomplish several times before in my life?

### I didn't quit once, I quit every single day

I stopped being a 'heavy' smoker a long time ago. I would hardly ever smoke more than 3-5 sticks a day. Once I even cut down to smoking only when I was out - just occasionally. And now when I look back at my earlier attempts, quitting was never a one time thing. This time around, I made a conscious decision to NOT smoke, everyday, regardless of the circumstances. And I stuck by it. Being consistent in anything takes a lot of will power. And if you are anything like me, you would want to know the why.

### I knew exactly why 

There are so many theories out there, of how you need [21 days](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonselk/2013/04/15/habit-formation-the-21-day-myth/) to form a habit, [10,000 hours](https://www.businessinsider.com/expert-rule-10000-hours-not-true-2017-8) to master a skill and such. And I have tried to test these out several times on my own. The problem was, somewhere along the way, the 'why' faded in importance to me and I failed. This time around, I was fully aware of the 'why' every single day. To me, this was the key to being consistent. 

### I knew it was completely possible

Being around smokers who lived their lives comfortably certainly did not help. But at the same time, I also observed how many people actually did not need to smoke at all. It was a glass half-full/half-empty situation. I was convinced it was entirely possible to live the life I wanted without smoking, just look at all those people!

These are quite important lessons to me. Looking back at my minor success, this framework worked quite well for me to achieve something I wanted. In an attempt to generalise this framework and replicate this success in other parts of my life, I will summarise the three key points above:


1. You don't just achieve something overnight, you work for it everyday
2. You need to know exactly why you are working towards it every single day
3. Convince yourself that you can do it, and keep reminding yourself how you are capable

We always tout the importance of learning from our failures and mistakes. While failures are valuable lessons, it's also quite important to look back at our successes and strengthen our formulas instead of just riding the highs. 


Here's to achieving all that we desire.
