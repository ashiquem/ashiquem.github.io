Whenever we try to learn something new, there's usually more than one way of acquiring that skill. Some prefer a certain medium over the other e.g. books over videos, others learn better by just diving head first. There's a ton of self-help articles and other resources out there, promising to teach you the secrets of learning to learn better, hacks to acquire any skill dubiously fast  (just google how to play the guitar or piano) etc. But what could be the best way for you to pick up a new skill?

The answer could depend on the skill you want to develop. Or at least that's what looking around the world will tell you. Think music - if you want to learn to play an instrument, common advice would be to just pick it up and start playing with it. You would probably hire a professional guitarist to help you out with some lessons, or in todays age - just find some online course. You probably won't spend years learning about music theory and notations before you actually touch the instrument. Contrast this with learning how to architect a building. Common advice for a starting point would definitely not be to just download some architectural designs from the internet and studying them. You would probably be encouraged to learn a bit of math, physics,acquire some computing skills, enrol in an institute, study for 5 years, work as an apprentice for a while and then be licensed to architect a building. Well, that sounds like a lot of time and commitment till you actually get to do what you want. There could be a good reason as to why most STEM occupations involve such a path (think about safety) and sometimes it does make sense. But for the others, the path to doing something you really want to do doesn't need to be that long. 

This contrasts two different learning approaches: the bottoms up and the tops down approach. When you choose the former, you learn all the fundamentals first, use them to learn the building blocks and later put everything together to do what you want. With the latter approach, you dive head first with the problem, figure out the smaller pieces it takes to get good at it, them acquire whatever you need. 

I am a big fan of the tops down approach. It helps me stay motivated towards my goal and I know exactly why I'm learning a certain thing. Whereas in a bottoms up approach, you don't have that clarity of how relevant your present effort could be towards your final goal. 

A month ago, I decided to learn how to solve problems with deep learning. The huge spectrum of problems you could solve with deep learning really fascinated me and I wanted to get in on the action. There are so many applications out there today utilising this technology, from language translation, self-driving cars to sales forecasting, I couldn't wait to play around with it. Just a couple of years back, usage of this technology was pretty much limited to researchers with PhDs and research scientists at huge tech companies. hings are looking a lot different these days, with a huge push to democratize AI skills. Being the avid self learner, I enrolled myself in Andrew Ng's popular Coursera specialization course on deep learning. Andrew is a great teacher and he explains difficult concepts in a really approachable manner. I just finished the fourth course of the specialisation, where I got to work on really exciting projects such as facial recognition and neural style transfer, which also helped me build up my technical skills. Working on these projects has been really fun but I wanted to benchmark my progress.

And so I have been scouring Kaggle to find some problems to solve with deep learning and put all my newly acquired skills to use. As I jumped from one kernel to the other, I realized that there are so many tricks and techniques out there that I'm completely unaware of. Another observation was how [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s name kept popping up in a lot of the top interesting kernels. 

fast.ai's mission seems to be quite simple and straightforward - get deep learning into the hands of as many people as possible and make them actually good at it. They have a course, which takes place in San Fransisco, and is also made available online in the form of a MOOC. Jeremy, who teaches the course, promises you the following:

> So the main thing that you're gonna hopefully agree at the end of this is that, you can do deep learning regardless of who you are. And I don't just mean do, we mean do at a very high level, I mean world class practitioner level deep learning.

And they've got the data to back it up. fast.ai student's have gone on to make [headlines](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17316010/fast-ai-speed-test-stanford-dawnbench-google-intel) in the AI community before and a the Kaggle community loves it as well. The only pre-requisites Jeremy puts forward is that you should have at least **1 year** of coding experience and be able to commit at least **70 hours** for the whole MOOC. So glad that I can tick both. I fired up the first lesson to get a taste of it and I was immediately sold. Jeremy takes a tops down approach to teaching you deep learning, showing you how to build world class deep learning solutions first, then digging deeper into why it all works.

So I decided to commit. This would help me blend Andrew's bottom's up approach with Jeremy's top down approach. And I want to benchmark the two approaches so that future learners could possibly benefit from my experience. In order to do so, I'll take up a computer vision problem from Kaggle and solve it with the knowledge and skills I have acquired through the deep learning specialization first. Then I'll come back to it again once I have finished the fast.ai's course.

The amazing thing about the human brain is that, it's constantly changing. There are new neural pathways being built whenever you learn something new and they get stronger over time as you activate those neurons over and over again. 

I am excited to share my progress at getting better with deep learning, stay tuned!
