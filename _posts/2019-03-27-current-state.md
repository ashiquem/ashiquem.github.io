It's been a while since I last posted here.

I decided to start writing in order to get better at communicating my ideas. With most things in life, if you want to get better at something, you just need to learn enough to get started and keep doing it. There's always enough things to write about. The human mind is fascinating, always buzzing with thoughts. I'm a huge fan of learning new things. And writing about everything I learn would be a great way of not only improving my communication skills, but would also help me understand new concepts better. Therefore, I commit to writing as often as possible.

Since I last posted, I have moved to Sydney, Australia. It's a really beautiful city and pretty big too with tons of exciting places to explore. 

I have also started working at this adtech company, Adslot, as a QA Automation Engineer. Before this, I had no idea about the world of digital marketing and media trading. One of our core products is called Symphony, the go to workflow software for many ditigal marketing agencies. The product team is not huge, unlike my previous company. In terms of the QA practices and processes, there's a lot of work to be done and I'm excited to use everything I have learned during my time in Sitecore to build it up here.

The data science and AI community in Sydney is amazing. There's always some event going on every week. This was one of the biggest reasons for me to choose Sydney over Melbourne. I attended one such event yesterday and it was such a great experience. Also, I started the second term of Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree.

I'm super excited to write about all the new things I learn from the nanodegree, from the challenges at work and my new life here in Australia. 

Stay tuned.
