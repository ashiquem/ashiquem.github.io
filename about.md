## Hello there!

Thanks for your interest in getting to know me. I have always left those 'bio' sections blank in all social media platforms for my entire life but I guess I can't pull that here on my own blog. 

So I hope you find the following information serves your purpose of visiting this page:

* I find AI quite fascinating and I like to talk about things that fascinate me
* I'm from Dhaka, Bangladesh
* I spent the last six years in the sunny tropical Malaysia
* I earned my Bachelor's in Egnineering from Monash University there
* I spent about 2 years working for Sitecore as a software test engineer
* Taking on new challenges excite me 
* Solving problems gives me adrenaline 
* I'm trying to like house music
* I'm on my way to build a career in AI and data science

If you wish to know more,feel free to reach out to me through any of the platforms at the bottom of this page, I'd love to have a chat.

Have a great day!
