#### Hello there!

Welcome to my blog and thanks for your interest in getting to know me!

Here's a little summary:

#### Education

I am an engineer at heart, I enjoy building things. I studied electrical and computer systems engineering at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/). I had great time there, working on a wide spectrum of problems. One of the things that I am really proud of was my final year project, where I conducted a research into how we can develop lighting which helps keep humans stay alert and more productive. 

I am a firm believer of lifelong learning. I have been greatly fascinated by machine learning & data science lately and I started studying through various MOOCs. After graduating from Udacity's [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t), I developed a great taste for deep learning and currently I'm working through Andrew Ng's [deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). 

#### Work

I got a great opportunity to work for [Sitecore](https://www.sitecore.com/) straight after graduating from college. Sitecore is a leading web content management system and marketing automation software. I worked for Sitecore for almost 2 years as a software test engineer. At Sitecore, I developed testing frameworks and automated tests for reporting and analytics applications. 

After almost two years at Sitecore, and almost six years in Malaysia, I have decided to move down under to Sydney, Australia. I'm looking forward to exciting opportunities there!

#### Interests

I enjoy rock climbing, going to concerts, travelling, hiking and photography. I have recently developed and interest in film making, and I hope to launch my YouTube channel soon. Stay tuned! 

If you wish to know more, feel free to reach out to me through any of the platforms at the bottom of this page, I'd love to have a chat.

Have a great day!
